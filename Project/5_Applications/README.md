# Applications

* In this project, an Arduino control of Relay is explained using a high current DC motor.
* As mentioned earlier, the circuit can be extended AC systems. Such circuits can be used to implement AC motor control, home automation, remote control of appliances etc.
* This circuit can also be implement in high power DC systems like motors, servos etc.
* It is used in speed based appilcations of motor.
* It is used in controlling unit of motors in vehicles and robots.
